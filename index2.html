    <h1>Auto Biography</h1>
<div class="bio"><p class="autobiography">

    I, James Byron Dean, was born February 8, 1931, Marion, Indiana. <br>
    My parents, Winton Dean and Mildred Dean, formerly Mildred Wilson, and myself existed <br>
    in the state of Indiana until I was six years of age. Dad’s work<br>
    with the government caused a change, so Dad as a <br>
    dental mechanic was transferred to California. There we lived,<br>
    until the fourth year. Mom became ill and passed out of my life at the age of nine. <br>
    I never knew the reason for Mom’s death; in fact, it still preys on my mind. <br>
    I had always lived such a talented life. I studied violin,<br>
    played in concerts, tap-danced on theatre stages, but most of all, I like art, <br>
    to mold and create things with my hands. I came back <br>
    to Indiana to live with my uncle. I lost the dancing and violin, but not the art.<br>
    I think my life will be devoted to art and dramatics. <br>
    And there are so many different fields of art it would<br>
    be hard to foul-up, and if I did, there are so many different things <br>
    to do–farm, sports, science, geology, coaching, teaching music. <br>
    I got it, and I know if I better myself that there will be no match. A fellow<br>
    must have confidence. When living in California my <br>
    young eyes experienced many things. It was also my luck<br>
    to make three visiting trips to Indiana, going and coming a different <br>
    route each time. I have been in almost every state west of Indiana. <br>
    I remember all. My hobby, or what I do in my spare time, is motorcycle. I know<br>
    a lot about them mechanically, and I love to ride. I have <br>
    been in a few races and have done well. I own a<br>
    small cycle myself. When I’m not doing that, I’m usually engaged <br>
    in athletics, the heartbeat of every American boy. As one strives <br>
    to make a goal in a game, there should be a goal in this crazy world for<br>
    all of us. I hope I know where mine is, anyway. <br>
    I’m after it. I don’t mind telling you, Mr. Dubois–this<br>
    is the hardest subject to write about considering the <br>
    information one knows of himself, I ever attempted.<br>
<br>
    “My Case Study” to Roland Dubois,
<br>
    Fairmount High School Principal, 1948
